1. Lower case unless it is normally capitalized (e.g., a bacterial family name, certain disease names).
2. Singular (vs. plural).
3. Abbreviations in brackets for commonly used phrases or disease names are allowed. Probably best to have both forms. (e.g., `varicella-zoster virus (VZV)` and `varicella-zoster virus`).
